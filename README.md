# 🧮 Quadratic Equation Solver

**A simple C++ console application to solve quadratic equations efficiently and interactively.**

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Quadratic Equation Solver** is a lightweight command-line program that helps you solve quadratic equations of the form:

[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
]

The program calculates the **discriminant**, identifies the nature of the roots (real or complex), and displays the corresponding results in a clear, formatted output.
It’s designed with an interactive menu that lets users **restart or exit** easily — perfect for quick calculations and testing.
